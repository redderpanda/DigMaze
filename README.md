The Game:
This game is a 2D RPG game.  The player is a white block and must dig to acquire gems in the ground.  Once obtaining all the gems, the player can exit the level.  There are bombs inside the ground that the player can hit while digging.  Bombs can be somewhat detected by the player by the ticking sound they make.  The player can tell how close the bombs are to them by the intensity of the ticking.  If the player digs up a bomb, they will die.  There are also metal blocks in the ground that the player can't dig through.

Controls:
The player can move around with either the WASD or the arrow keys.  When the player wants to dig, they must hold the direction they want to dig and press the SPACE bar or left-click with their mouse.  Picking up gems and exiting the map happen by simply running into them.  There is a tutorial on the first level that runs through these controls.  The text advances by clicking with the mouse.

The Goal:
I want the player to feel anxious everytime they dig into the next block.  The ticking creates stress for the player, but uncertainty as well because the bombs could be in any direction around them.  I wanted the player to also think as they played my game.  Because there are different intensities of the ticking, the player can discern generally where bombs are.
